<!-- 魔音助手是一款智能会议记录、课程笔记工具，旨在提高人们的工作学习效率。产品可以把音视频转成文字，实现基于声纹识别的说话人分离，基于账户级热词库的个性化ASR语音识别，自动生成会议纪要、课程摘要、字幕翻译等等。支持搜索视频内容从任意文字处播放，通过编辑文字对视频进行剪辑，自动检测说话人并可一键删除音视频空白，自动同步会议、课程记录至邮箱、钉钉群、印象笔记、百度网盘等。公司创始团队来自北大、哈佛、阿里、网易、百度、360、联想、快手等名校和一线互联网企业。

疫情加速改变了人们工作学习的方式，视频会议和在线视频课程的爆发式增长给魔音助手这款在线工作学习效率工具提供了流量红利，未来将有更多用户养成线上办公与学习的习惯，线下向线上场景的迁移已经成为一个确定性的趋势，魔音助手将会成为人们整理工作学习资料的得力工具。随着用户量的提升，用户的每一次修正都会使得ASR识别更准确，更智能，成为人们工作学习生活中不可替代的一款产品。随着用户和内容的累积，未来产品可以发展成为一个视频搜索引擎，将全网的视频内容转成文本，输入任何问题都能搜出不同人的视频回答，类似视频版的百度，市场前景巨大。

魔音智能具备个性化ASR识别的能力，客户的每次校对可以个性化的训练语言和声学模型，实现账户级的个性化识别体验，因此客户使用越多识别越精准。而科大讯飞、搜狗等大厂主要是做通用语音识别接口的开发，追求的是通用场景下识别正确率，因此在每个账号特定应用场景下的识别率会低一些。我们具备自主研发的说话人分离技术，在特定会议场景进行大规模近远场收声数据训练，大大提升会议场景下说话人分离的识别效果。会议纪要也是大厂目前未实现的功能，我们使用大规模会议纪要数据对BERT模型进行训练，使得机器可以在大量数据中抽象出会议记录中的重点，结论，以及工作安排等。支持基于会议记录建立企业知识库，方便内部音视频会议以及文件资料数据的检索分析。

Moyin Assistant is a smart automatic voice meeting note/video lecture note taker, aiming to increase users work/study efficiency. Its main features are automatic video transcription, speaker diarization based on voiceprint technology, personalized automatic speech recognition technology, automatic meeting/lecture note summary, closed caption translation etc. User can search and play from any key word/speaker, edit video/audio by editing transcript, and remove silence clips based on voice activity detection technology. Meeting/lecture notes can be synchronized automatically with E-mail/DingDing/Evernote/Baidu Cloud etc. The team comes from a diverse background of world class organizations such as Peking University, Harvard University, Alibaba, Netease, Baidu, 360, Lenovo, Kuaishou etc.

The pandemic has rapidly changed the way people work/study. As video conferencing and online learning become more prevalent, it presents a great opportunity for Moyin Assistant to acquire a large user base as more and more people will develop a habit of working and studying online. People need Moyin Assistant to organize their work/study materials and to improve their productivity. Each correction from user will make the automatic speech recognition engine smarter, and eventually make the product an indispensable tool. With a larger user base, the product has the potential to become a video search engine in the future. Once all video content on the internet are transcribed into text, people will be able to search anything and watch only the relevant video clips from various sources. This video version of “Baidu” has a large market potential.

Personalized automatic speech recognition is one of Moyin Technology’s core capabilities. Every correction from users are used to train the acoustic and language models on the account level. Hence, the more Moyin Assistant is used, the more accurate its speech recognition is. We also developed our own speaker diarization model based on voiceprint technology, deep learning algorithms and large scale model training. We are capable of providing automatic meeting/lecture summaries based on cutting edge natural language processing technology such as BERT models, allowing machine to extract key information such conclusions, next steps etc. from meeting/lecture notes. In the future, meeting data will enable further analysis, reveal business insights and help companies to make more informative decisions. -->
